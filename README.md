# AB4COGT
A Baseline for CARLA Online Ground-Truth Generation

This GitHub repository stores both code used to develop AB4COGT and CARLA ground-truth and LiDAR point clouds generated by using AB4COGT.

## Code
In code folder, files to reproduce AB4COGT are stored.

CARLA_groundtruth_sync_v2.py can be used to store both LiDAR point clouds to .npy and ground-truth to .txt files in KITTI format.

CARLA_groundtruth_to_ROS.py can be used to reproduce the previously stored .npy LiDAR point clouds to ROS PointCloud2 topic.

## Standalone
In standalone folder, scene 0004 used for AB4COGT paper validation is stored.

Ground-truth is stored in 0004.txt using CARLA_groundtruth_sync_v2.py

LiDAR point cloud can be reproduced in ROS PointCloud2 topic by executing CARLA_groundtruth_to_ROS.py
